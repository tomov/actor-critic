here -- happen instentaneously

but they don't have to overlap -- drift paper

1) show vanilla model -- it indeed doesn't work
2) if we add either assumption (or another assumption)
3) ask the same thing about Q-learning -- can we make Q-learning do that

conclusion: this experiment doesn't tell us if it's not actor critic, or maybe it doesn't tell us anything??


show how it works how it doesn't work
critical assumptions that make it work
dividing or combining the two PE's


Nomoto -- PE's of cue and action -- separate! (animal has to take its time)
here -- not necessarily => instentaneous

RL Glue -- for RL algos
