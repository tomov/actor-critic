C = number of cues

C lines, each line in the format:
cue_name    cue_value

N = number of states
N lines, each line in the format:
state_name      state_reward      state_type    state_cue     extra

where state_type = Deterministic or Probabilistic, and state_cue is either a cue_name from the previous list, or a non-existing cue name for non-cue states. extra is just a bonus term carrying extra information

the next lines denote the transitions, each in the format:
from_state      to_state      probability | action_name

where from_state and to_state are state_names from the previous list. If the state_type of the from_state is Probabilistic, the third parameter is the probability of the transition. Otherwise, it is the action_name of the action.





//////// RETRO /////////////

by convention, cue states are named in the format "cue-X", where X is a single letter corresponding to the cue identifier. For each X, there can only be one "cue-X" state

by convention, go states for decision trials are named in the format "go-XY" where X and Y are the corresponding cue identifiers. By convention, X is the lower-reward one and Y is the higher-reward one. Also, the first transition (in order of input) from that state is the low one, and the next one is the high one.

by convention, go states for reference trials are named in the format "go-X" where X is the corresponding cue identifier. The first transition (in order of input) from that state is the correct one, i.e. the one that goes to a reward state.
