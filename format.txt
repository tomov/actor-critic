N = number of states

N lines 0..N-1, each in the format:
R name type
where R = reward for state i, name = name of state i, type = Probabilistic or Choice, meaning that at this state, the animal either has to make a choice between future states, or it needs to passively wait while the trial picks the next state probabilistically.

the next lines are in the format:
s1 s2 name (prob)
Each line describes an transition from state s1 to state s2 with name name. If s1 is a state with type = Probabilistic, then the prob parameter must also be included. It says what is the probability that this transition will happen. The sum of these for every s1 must be 1.


by convention, cue states are named in the format "cue-X", where X is a single letter corresponding to the cue identifier. For each X, there can only be one "cue-X" state

by convention, go states for decision trials are named in the format "go-XY" where X and Y are the corresponding cue identifiers. By convention, X is the lower-reward one and Y is the higher-reward one. Also, the first transition (in order of input) from that state is the low one, and the next one is the high one.

by convention, go states for reference trials are named in the format "go-X" where X is the corresponding cue identifier. The first transition (in order of input) from that state is the correct one, i.e. the one that goes to a reward state.
